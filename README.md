CMU-PVP-Playground
================

This repository provides a non-trivial example of setting up a C++ project using the CMake cross-platform compiler and the Boost unit testing framework.

The project structure is provided below:

```
.
├── bin/                                # Folder for built application binary
│   └── cmake_boost_demo                # Built application executable
├── cmake/                              # CMake build folder
│   ├── shared/                         # CMake artifacts
│   └── test/                           # Compiled test folder
│       └── cmake_boost_demo_unit_tests # Built unit tests executable
├── src/                                # Folder for all source files
│   ├── shared/                         # Shared classes
│   └── main.cpp                        # Main entry of the application
├── test/                               # Test folder for all unit tests
│   ├── shared/                         # Shared classes
│   └── CMakeLists.txt                  # Compile script for unit tests
└── CMakeLists.txt                      # Main compile script
```

## Dependencies

This project was built and tested on the Mac OS X platform with the
following dependencies:

* CMake >= 3.10
* Boost >= 1.61

## Instructions

Do as you would any CMake project to compile:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Run application:

```
cd bin
./cmake_boost_demo
```

Run unit test suite:

```
cd build/test
ctest
```
